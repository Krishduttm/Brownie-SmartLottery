# Brownie-SmartLottery

This is a smart lottery system which picks a random account (Using chainlink VRF random chooser)
To enter the lottery, an account must pay 50$ equivalent of ether. If amount is lesser than 50$, the entry will be rejected
After the lottery ends, an account is chosen as a winner and all the funds are transferred to that account.
I have used brownie as the development framework and used solidity to code the smart contract.
